# CallPilot – Agentic Voice AI for Autonomous Appointment Scheduling

CallPilot is an AI-powered voice agent designed to autonomously book appointments on behalf of users. The system places phone calls to service providers, negotiates available time slots through natural conversation, and selects the optimal appointment based on user preferences such as availability, distance, and provider quality.

The agent is built using ElevenLabs Conversational AI and leverages agentic tool-calling to make real-time decisions during calls. It integrates with calendar systems to prevent double booking and ensures that suggested appointments fit the user’s schedule.

For scalability, CallPilot supports a multi-call outreach mode where multiple providers can be contacted in parallel. Each call runs independently, and results are aggregated using a scoring function to recommend the best available option to the user.

This project demonstrates how voice AI can move beyond conversation into real-world execution, automating one of the most common and time-consuming daily tasks: appointment scheduling.
